# Repository for Outside and Inside Simulations

You can run the repo exactly like we ran the turtlebot project, all of the same commands should work. 
To change the world file, simply modify it in the launch and setup .py world file. 

The indoor simulation is in lloyd.wbt, and it is the academic section of the first floor of Lloyd. 
The outdoor simulation is in square.wbt, and it is from 15th street to Paul Bryant, and 12th Ave to Hackeberry. 

There are two files in the world file to compare each of the pictures to.
